Repo for Physics 5300 Final Problem Set by Adithya Reji

Visited by Dick Furnstahl

Lagrangian_pendulum.ipynb has the solution for the double pendulum, a & b are done for this part, there's some part for c with documentation on what is happening

Orbital_eqs_with_different_algorithms.ipynb has the solution for the Gravitational Orbits problem, there's a & b done, there's some documentation in comments on what the figure is doing (part c), Leapfrog method for part d has been attempted in the second plot, however the axes are incorrect and not displaying the orbits appropriately
